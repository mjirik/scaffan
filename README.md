## Known issues

There are two problems with `openslide` (not with `openslide-python`) package on windows. 
* The package is not in conda channel. This is solved by automatic download of the dll binaries.
* Dll binaries cannot be used together with libxml. There is workaround in scaffan. 
It uses subprocess call to process separately image data and image annotations.
